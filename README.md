# Projects I did on Udacity as part of the Data Engineering with AWS certification

It contains the code submitted as part of the certification fpr the following projects
* **Data Warehouse:** the music streaming startup, Sparkify, allows their users to stream music from their S3 servers and now they want to analyze the user trends in order to inform their product. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
* **Data Pipelines with Airflow:** Developed a data pipeline in Airflow that extracts data from an S3 bucket and loads it into a Redshift data warehouse. During processing, the pipeline performs data quality checks, enabling the identification of potential issues and allowing for process improvements as needed. The implementation also ensures easy monitoring of data lineage and quality throughout the pipeline, supporting informed decision-making for continuous optimization.
* **STEDI Human Balance Analytics:** The project will extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer team into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientist and Data Analysts can use to visualize information or train the learning model that will help to improve the product being developed.
